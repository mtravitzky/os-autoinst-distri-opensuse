  Create a 2 nodes cluster

  Schedule for a custom cluster on maintenance.

  Some modules are executed or skipped depending the
  targeted package.

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_NAME must be defined for all jobs as a string.
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT must be defined to yes in the job that initializes the cluster, and to no
  in the remaining cluster node jobs
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN must be defined for the rest of the jobs, and it must contain the
  hostname of the job where HA_CLUSTER_INIT is defined to yes
  HOSTNAME must be defined to different hostnames for each node.
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  NICTYPE and WORKER_CLASS must be set to 'tap' in the job group directly in qemu based jobs.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.
